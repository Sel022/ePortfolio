# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome to my **CS 499 ePortfolio**, the culmination of my Computer Science degree program.  
This portfolio demonstrates my growth as a computer scientist, showcasing both technical depth and professional reflection.  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Program Growth & Reflection
Throughout this program, I developed skills in **software design, algorithms and data structures, databases, security, and full-stack development**.  

- **Early courses** built my foundation in programming, problem solving, and working with data structures.  
- **Mid-program projects** (e.g., CS 350 Thermostat) challenged me to integrate **hardware with software** while applying engineering best practices.  
- **Advanced courses** (e.g., CS 465 MEAN App) strengthened my skills in **databases, backend APIs, and modern web frameworks**.  
- The **Capstone Project** allowed me to revisit and enhance these artifacts, applying feedback, best practices, and lessons learned.

## ðŸ”— Connection to Artifacts & Outcomes
- **CS 350 Smart Thermostat** demonstrates **Outcomes 1, 2, 4, 5** through modular embedded design, algorithmic state logic, and secure hardware control.  
- **CS 465 MEAN App** demonstrates **Outcomes 1, 3, 4, 5** through full-stack design, database optimization, secure API practices, and professional documentation.
