## 📖 Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout the computer science program at SNHU, I strengthened skills in:  

- **Software Design & Engineering**: modular, testable, maintainable code  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: efficient, reliable logic with real-time constraints  
- **Databases**: schema design, indexing, validation, and secure queries  
- **Security Mindset**: safe GPIO access, sanitized inputs, authenticated routes  
- **Professional Communication**: documentation, code reviews, and clear narratives  

This portfolio demonstrates how I applied these outcomes in real-world style projects and then enhanced them during the capstone.
