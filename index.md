# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome! This ePortfolio showcases my growth across the Computer Science program through two enhanced artifacts and a code review. It highlights my strengths in **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **databases**, along with a professional, employer-facing presentation.

## How coursework and this ePortfolio shaped my skills, goals, and employability

**Collaboration & peer workflows.** I practiced collaborative development through code reviews, branching strategies, and issue tracking. In the capstone, I formalized a **code review** to explain existing functionality, analyze improvement areas (structure, efficiency, testing, security), and justify planned enhancements—mirroring professional team practices.  

**Stakeholder communication.** I translated technical plans into clear narratives and UI/UX-friendly pages. Each artifact page explains business value, design trade-offs, and measurable outcomes in accessible language while still giving technical depth.  

**Data structures & algorithms.** I applied state-machine logic and time-based control for **embedded thermostat behavior** (setpoint, hysteresis, mode cycling) and optimized query patterns in the **MEAN** application (pagination, indexes, and validation). These choices balanced correctness, performance, and maintainability.

**Software engineering & databases.** I refactored embedded Python into modules (sensing, state management, I/O), integrated UART logging, and improved testability. In the MEAN app, I clarified **MongoDB schema design**, added validation and indexing, and hardened **API endpoints** with authentication checks and error handling.

**Security mindset.** I reviewed GPIO access patterns and safe hardware control paths for the thermostat, and implemented **auth + input validation** in the MEAN backend. I considered common risks (injection, weak session handling, least privilege for DB ops) and added mitigations.

## How the artifacts fit together

- **CS 350 Smart Thermostat (Raspberry Pi):** Embedded, real-time control with sensor input, LEDs/LCD feedback, UART logging, and a state machine that manages OFF/HEAT/COOL behavior. Demonstrates **software design/engineering** and **algorithms/data structures** in a hardware-integrated context.

- **CS 465 MEAN Travel Booking App:** Full-stack SPA with Angular + Express + MongoDB, covering **database** design, API construction, validation, and deployment considerations.

Together, these artifacts show range (embedded → full-stack), depth (clean architecture, testing, and security), and alignment to all three rubric categories. This homepage serves as the entry point to the technical pages that follow.

## What you’ll find in this ePortfolio

- A **Code Review** with existing functionality, code analysis, and an enhancement plan tied to course outcomes.  
- Two **enhanced artifacts** with narratives explaining the “why,” “what,” and “how,” plus reflections on challenges, feedback, and outcomes.

> The capstone requires a self-assessment front page, a code review, and narratives for enhanced artifacts that demonstrate software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and databases. This structure is reflected in the navigation above.
