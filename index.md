Self- Assesement 

Introduction
I am Path throughout my studies at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained valuable knowledge and practical skills in computer science, software development, and data analysis. These courses, combined with my prior experience in software testing, have allowed me to grow both academically and professionally.
This self-evaluation highlights what I have learned from my courses, how I have applied this knowledge, and how these skills will support my career goals in the future.
What I Have Learned
1. Software Development & Testing
‚Ä¢	Developed a strong understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and its importance in delivering high-quality, maintainable software.
‚Ä¢	Gained experience in software testing automation using Selenium WebDriver with Java, including writing and executing test cases, setting up frameworks, and verifying functionality.
‚Ä¢	Practiced different types of testing: functional, performance, and security.
‚Ä¢	Strengthened coding skills in Java and Python for test automation and problem-solving.
2. Databases & Data Handling
‚Ä¢	Learned to write SQL queries for managing relational databases.
‚Ä¢	Worked with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations and manage unstructured data in projects.
‚Ä¢	Understood the importance of database design, client-server systems, and efficient data storage for application development.
3. Full-Stack Development (CS-465)
‚Ä¢	Learned the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) to build complete web applications.
‚Ä¢	Acquired skills in:
o	Front-end development (HTML, CSS, Angular) for user interfaces.
o	Back-end development (Node.js, Express.js) for APIs and server logic.
o	Database integration using MongoDB for dynamic data management.
‚Ä¢	Understood how to connect front-end, back-end, and databases into fully functioning applications.
4. Project Management & Methodologies
‚Ä¢	Applied Agile methodology and used Jira for managing team-based projects.
‚Ä¢	Learned how to analyze project requirements, create wireframes, design class diagrams, and effectively communicate with stakeholders.
‚Ä¢	Developed confidence in working independently on milestone projects by applying structured planning and iterative development.
5. Data Analytics Foundations
