# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome to my **CS 499 ePortfolio**, the culmination of my Computer Science degree program.  
This portfolio demonstrates my growth as a computer scientist, showcasing both technical depth and professional reflection.  

Throughout this program, I developed skills in **software design, algorithms and data structures, databases, security, and full-stack development**.  
The artifacts selected for this ePortfolio represent enhanced projects from prior courses that highlight my ability to:  

- Apply **modular software engineering practices**  
- Implement **algorithms and control logic** in embedded systems  
- Design and optimize **databases** for scalability and security  
- Build and secure **full-stack applications**  
- Communicate effectively through **documentation and code review**  

---

## üìà Program Growth & Reflection
- **Early courses** built my foundation in programming, problem solving, and working with data structures.  
- **Mid-program** projects (e.g., CS 350 Thermostat) challenged me to integrate **hardware with software** while applying engineering best practices.  
- **Advanced courses** (e.g., CS 465 MEAN App) strengthened my skills in **databases, backend APIs, and modern web frameworks**.  
- The **Capstone Project** allowed me to revisit and enhance these artifacts, applying feedback, best practices, and lessons learned.  

This journey has helped me grow from a student focused on writing functional code into a professional who can design, evaluate, and maintain **robust, secure, and scalable software systems**.

## üîó Connection to Artifacts & Outcomes
- **CS 350 Smart Thermostat** demonstrates **Outcomes 1, 2, 4, 5** through modular embedded design, algorithmic state logic, and secure hardware control.  
- **CS 465 MEAN App** demonstrates **Outcomes 1, 3, 4, 5** through full-stack design, database optimization, secure API practices, and professional documentation.  

Both artifacts were enhanced using **peer and instructor feedback**:
- CS 350: added clearer code comments, standardized naming, and a ‚Äúsafe-off‚Äù GPIO routine.  
- CS 465: improved API error messages, documented DTOs, and unified authorization logic.
