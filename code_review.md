# Code Review Narrative

This informal code review explains existing functionality, analyzes improvement areas, and outlines planned enhancements.  
The audience is peers or a manager; the goal is clarity over deep technical detail.  

---

## A. Existing Functionality
- **CS 350 Thermostat:** Sensor reads (AHT20/I2C), state modes (OFF/HEAT/COOL), LEDs + LCD updates, UART logging cadence.  
- **CS 465 MEAN App:** SPA routing, login workflow, trips listing, edit trip form; REST API consuming MongoDB.  

---

## B. Code Analysis (Improvement Targets)
- Structure & readability: modularity, naming conventions.  
- Logic & efficiency: state machine clarity, non-blocking timers, pagination.  
- Testing & observability: mockable interfaces, logging.  
- Security: auth checks, input validation, least-privilege DB ops.  
- Commenting & documentation.  

---

## C. Enhancement Plan & Outcomes
- **CS 350:** Module split, LCD/UART services, robust button handling, hysteresis control, timer-based scheduling.  
- **CS 465:** Schema validation, indexes, protected routes, pagination.

## D. Video Walkthrough (to be recorded)
In the video walkthrough, I will:  
1. Introduce the artifacts (CS 350 thermostat, CS 465 MEAN app).  
2. Explain existing functionality in the original code.  
3. Identify areas for improvement (modularity, validation, security, etc.).  
4. Walk through enhancements I implemented.  
5. Connect the work to **CS program outcomes**.
